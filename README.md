# MITM_cli_tool

# Do not use this tool on other networks except your own!

## Description
This is a Show-Case Man-In-The-Middle Programm written in C for Linux systems.
Programmed only for local Networks, this is a good Programm to explain low-level network programming in c.
The Code allows only to capture the packages and give some basic information about the communicators. 
This is possible with the built-in ARP-Spoofing technique.
There is no further manipulation on the Package, because this is only a show-case and open-source.
(feel free to play with the handler :-))

**Used libaries:**
- standard c-libary on linux
- libpcap (included in most operating systems
 otherwise just install it with your package-manager)
